A função `SUM ( )` também pode somar as duas colunas ou mais com o seguinte exemplo:
```sql
SELECT SUM(winner_goals + opponent_goals) FROM games;
```

É importante lembrar que não podemos aninhar os operadores como `SUM`, `AVG`!
O exemplo abaixo é incorreto!
```sql
SELECT AVG(SUM(winner_goals + opponent_goals)) from games
```
O exemplo abaixo é correto!
```sql
SELECT AVG(winner_goals + opponent_goals) from games
```
